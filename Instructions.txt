Towards Deep Learning for Connectome Mapping: A Block Decomposition Framework

1. "det_BDS.m" and "prob_BDS.m" generates connectome for given block-image and nodes parcellation using Det-BDS and Prob-BDS algorithm respectively 

3.The example dataset provided contains DK parcellation for one dMRI ("atlas.mat" ) and corresponding block-image ("block_image.mat"). In the provided block-image, intra-block connections seperated by a euclidean distance of 2 are ignored (not connected).
